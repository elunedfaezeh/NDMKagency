## NDMK Agency Website 🚀
This project is a bespoke digital experience crafted for NDMK Agency in London.
What started as an Angular build evolved into a modern React + Next.js application with Tailwind CSS styling, delivering a sleek, fast, and scalable frontend.
Beyond just code, the focus was on UI/UX design excellence — every pixel, animation, and interaction was carefully designed to reflect the agency’s bold identity. The result? A website that not only looks stunning but also performs flawlessly across all devices. 🎨✨
